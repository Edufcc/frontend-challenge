# ðŸ’¡ About

I challenged myself to do this job challenge, to test my knowledge and skills as a frontend developer,

The challenge is to implement an e-commerce for the sale of mugs and t-shirts that should have the following functionalities:
 * Product catalog with pagination
 * Filter products by category
 * Search by product name
 * Add and remove products from cart
 * Checkout page
